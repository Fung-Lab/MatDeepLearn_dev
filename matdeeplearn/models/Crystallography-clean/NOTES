For a student to get started.

We have a mini material project dataset example. To run, use run-mini-plaindistance18-baseline.sh.

 *** The code is not well cleaned up. *** ***** 

But I just tested. It runs. 

There are two key files: model_my4.py model_my45.py.  These implement edge convolution and multihead attention . model.py is a baseline implementation.  You can choose by setting the 'my' option in the run script.  Depending on the number of attention heads, the mode can be slow to train. 

The raw cif files are under MaterialMini.  They are pre-processed into npz file using the usual cut-off max-neighbor set up.  gen.sh script will generate those. You can change those settings in the gen.sh script.
 
This is based on the geoCGNN repository.  It also contains a bunch of stuff that I explored that you are not likely to use. 

**As mentioned in the run script, the nbr vector size is hardcoded.  You might want to watch out for other hardcoded stuff **
