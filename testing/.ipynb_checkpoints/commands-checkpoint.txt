memory leak observations
- occurring near end of first run of forward (nothing at end is printed out)
- dataset and OTF are not the issue
- Issue is narrowed down to ALIGNN conv layer's forward
- Edge and Node model may have issues, each respective forward consumes ~100mb which is the issue

second time node model issue - second time we do
